Compute the Lucas numbers: L(n)=L(n−1)+L(n−2), n>1; F(0)=2; F(1)=1.

## Question a

Write a recursive function to compute L(n) using the above definition directly. Implement the solution and print F (i ∗ 5), where 0 ≤ i ≤ 10, as output.

## Question b

Write a function/procedure to compute L(n) with time complexity O(n) (more precisely, the time complexity should be O(nA(n)) when n is large, where A(n) is the complexity of adding L(n − 1) and L(n − 2)). Implement the solution and print L (i ∗ 20), where 0 ≤ i ≤ 25, as output. This program must be able to compute L(n) precisely for n ≤ 500.
